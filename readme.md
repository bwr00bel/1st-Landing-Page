# __Sauna project- 1st portfolio project made in Front- End Technology__

Hello everyone!

I'd like to introduce my first commercial front-end project which was made for my friend some time ago. 
Currently I study Java technology and focus on back-end fields. But I decided to show you my improvement way and indicate that I'm flexible whith getting a new skills in different technologies.
I'm sure if there could be opportunity to work with front-end stack it will be just quick review to start working with.

So let's check this project out!

Mostly, my main point was to focus on my modern CSS skills - Flexbox and SCSS. Before I started deep programming leraning I used a simple JQuery funcionality for this website. 
At that time I was aware of beggining my programming trip. However, I was really determined to study lots of new stuff to be the best in this profession.
So be welcomed to visit and have a look at my work!
